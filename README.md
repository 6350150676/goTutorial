# Go Tutorial Practice

This repository contains my code from the [Go Programming Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzjZaW71kMwSEVpdbHPr0nPo5zdzbDulm) playlist by **ProgrammingKnowledge**.  
Itâ€™s a collection of small programs and examples I wrote while learning Go.

## Topics Covered
- Variables, constants, and data types  
- Control structures (`if`, `for`, `switch`)  
- Functions and multiple return values  
- Arrays, slices, and maps  
- Structs, methods, and interfaces  
- Error handling  
- Concurrency with goroutines and channels  
- File handling

## Running the Code
1. Install [Go](https://go.dev/dl/).  
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
